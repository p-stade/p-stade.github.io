<p>From 28th to 29th of March 2014 the conference "<a href="http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/2481/" target="_blank">Creativity, Circulation and Copyright: Sonic and Visual Media in the Digital Age</a>" took place in Cambridge at <a href="http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CRASSH</a>. The interdisciplinary approach raised very different issues and interesting methodologies and questions were discussed. I will try to summarize some of the talks which I found the most interesting.</p>
<h3><strong>Keith Negus / John Street / Adam Behr: </strong><em><b>Digitisation and the Politics of Copying in Popular Music Culture</b></em></h3>
<p>Negus, Street and Behr<b> </b>are conducting their research in the <a href="http://www.create.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CREATe</a> project and they interviewed several musicians in order to find about more about their view on copyright issues. Here is their abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>„</em>Musicians are at the forefront of discussions around revenue loss in the music industry, yet often neglected in existing studies which usually focus on corporate perspectives or audience activities. Drawing on extensive interviews with musicians operating in different genres - and at different points in their careers – within the broad field of popular music this paper presents initial observations from an investigation of how the notion of ‘original’ ideas and rights of access (and hence copyright) are negotiated by practicing musicians. How do they regard duplicating without permission in order to circulate free copies or bootlegs? How do they see the practice of appropriating, reusing, sampling and imitating? How does this relate to the existing legal and policy framework?<br />
With an ever-wider range of technical possibilities blurring the boundaries between production and distribution - sampling, remixing and ‘mash-ups’ - the legal mechanisms for protecting musical creativity have fallen behind both the practical means by which copyright can be breached and, crucially, the conceptual framework within which many practitioners now operate. At the same time, copying of various forms has long been intrinsic to the processes of both making music and learning how to do so. This paper begins to unpick the ways in which musicians regard different types of copying and how they feed into musical meaning, ideas of ‘fair use’ (legal and moral), attendant concepts of musical ownership and the distinctions between ‘originality’, ‘imitation’ ‘creativity’ and ‘innovation’.“</p></blockquote>
<p align="left">Behr started the talk reminding us that Beethoven copied from Mozart while John Lennon was hit by law-suits when he copied. To find out more on the opinions of professional musicians they asked them, whether they allow to remix or How they circulate their work. Behr stated that there is an ethical dilemma of music when it comes to those topics and presented some early findings. Most of the musicians described their creative practice like this: “work first – deal with legal implications later”. Often they know that the product will be cleared by labels afterwards. But acts that are further up the financial scale  and more prominent take more account of these issues prior to release. The musicians where also mentioning their „hinterlands of inspiration“ and their struggle between precaution or „we trust that nobody will sue us“. It seems to be normal that after having produced 4 albums you start to check it by a musicologist and you are extra careful on radio. Behr found different attitudes between sample based and „classical” musicians: sample-musicians reference by using samples and they take a lick like in jazz, they chop them up beyond recognisability. Some of them described the importance of properly sampling because it shows that „I have done my homework“ and that „You are in a tradition when you sample“. Overall the interviews showed a generational difference: young people tend to give their music away for free while older musicians have other experiences with record label-deals and collecting society. Younger people tend to think that there is no money for being long time in the studio and there is less and less money in the system. For them live performance is getting more important. Street stressed that their main method – the  interviews – had to be accompanied by other methods: How are the legal discourses and the „authority of politics“ framing creativity?</p>

<p align="left">Behr illustrated copyright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale" target="_blank">conflicts between the organist player and the composers of Procol Harum's Whiter Shade of Pale</a>. The complicated case called <a href="http://www.leeandthompson.com/2009/09/24/fisher-%E2%80%93v-brooker-others-2009-ukhl-41/" target="_blank">Fisher v Brooker</a> was finished in 2009 and the organist Fisher won the case and got his share of the royalties. With regard to the creative process Negus, Street and Behr came up with questions that dealt with distinctiveness of music and percentages of contribution as this case showed. For the law it is difficult to find equality in such decisions.</p>

<p align="left">They also mentioned the case Vincent Peters v. Kanye West which ruled on the resemblance of Kanye West’s “Stronger” lyrics to the lyrics of Vince P who also referred to Kate Moss in his song "Stronger". A musicologist or a reasonable juror had to decide about the rhyming scheme. It was argued that this case is in the conventions and therfore no rip off. But another point could also lead to problems when it comes to judgments in copright: Could someone have heard something before? Negus concluded that we can think of copying, creativity and circulation in terms of stages of development. In a first stage musicians have little concern about legal issues. But in the phase “pre-release product” the awareness rises. “Post-release product” you have to deal with legal challenges. Another finding of them was that the legal discourses seek orientation on “classical music” discourses which focus at pitch as a major distinction. After the talk the famous Bridgeport v Dimension Films, which was mentioned several times at the conference, case was discussed. With regard to shared myths that musicians keep on spreading although they are not true the scholars mentioned the idea that sampling a certain amount of seconds of a song is legal in general. Another aspect was that music producers like homages and that is why they don’t take them out although it could cause legal troubles.</p>
<h3 align="left"><b>Frédéric Döhl: <em>A Question of Context and Aura. About Copyright Laws Reaction to Digital Composing with Second Hand Sounds – with Special Regard to Mashup</em></b></h3>
<p align="left">Döhl’s focus in his talk was on sound-sampling and on the legal case “Metall auf Metall I &amp; II” that I described in another <a title="Online-Discourses on “Metall auf Metall” and Sampling" href="http://philip-stade.de/online-discourses-on-metall-auf-metall-and-sampling/" target="_blank">article of mine</a>. His abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Particularly due to widely acknowledged, theorized, and studied technological (pc, samplers, internet) and aesthetical (postmodernism, retromania) changes, the use of well- established practices of employing a musical reference has grown exponentially across the board from avant-garde music and jazz to all kinds of popular music genres during the last four decades. But has the massive quantitative change mutated in any respect to a qualitative change, too, bringing anything new to the wide and old field of musical borrowing (Burkholder, 1994; Schneider, 2004) with regard to both the production procedures and/or the reception and evaluation of these kinds of music?<br />
At least German copyright law has – in opposition to US copyright law – recently recognized this development in matters of sampling for its ability to create new from old, but stated immediately an intriguing exception of this newly opened up case of fair use: you are not allowed to sample if an »average producers« will be able to produce the sampled sound on his own. This is the classic objection against musical borrowing as an act of laziness and creative inability becoming copyright law.<br />
This paper deals with mashup as a case example, a genre of popular music (McGranahan, 2010; Sinnreich, 2010) which is totally based on large-scale sampling. In referring to its classic work, the Grey Album (2004) – a mashup of Jay-Z’s Black Album and The Beatles’ White Album –, and its story, this paper not only strives to exemplify how the ability to draw upon specific sounds changed by digitalization (Metzer, 2003) is fundamental to the aesthetic of mashup but to show how this ability indeed brought some qualitative changes (opposing Reynolds, 2011) towards not just performance quotation (Katz, 2010) but the creation of a virtual shared performance by artists/ensembles who in reality did not perform together, exemplifying how the mentioned exception for fair use misunderstands how important the fact is for the experience of such music based on sampling that the sounds you hear are actually produced by specific artists/ensembles and not by anybody, even if it would sound the same: the difference is a question of context and aura (Danto, 1964; Latour, 2011). With these arguments the current »average-producers«-jurisdiction will be explained and critically discussed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Döhl started that sampling is often seen as the borrowing of sound or a form of specific quoting. Mashup-artist distance themselves from traditional „composers“ and like to look at themselves as a new kind of artists. [[[[ Brian Eno-quote ]]] He mentioned the “Grey Album” from DJ Dangermouse – the most famous mashup album out there – and that Jay-Z recognised the creative work – but the rightsholders of the Beatles did not.</p>

<p>Döhl asked: Do we want to focus on copyright with the risk to loose artists like DJ Dangermouse? Döhl stated that that would be an unmusical idea. The German case “Metall auf Metall I &amp; II” which started in 1999 and did only end in 2012 tells a different story than Bridgeport v Dimension Films in the US. The Federal Court of Justice was referring to the Bridgeport case which said in 2005 “Get a license or so not sample“ but the German court contradicted: In general sound-sampling is regarded as being possible via “Free Use” (§ 23 UrhG). So the court shifted the question from how much is sampled to how it is sampled! Thereby it puts aesthetic aspects in the focus. But the requests for sampling music still are very high: no melody in the sample, an average-qualified music producer should not be capable of reproducing the sample, the new work has to be independent from the first and therefore the sample has to fade away (“Verblassen”). The problem lies in the fact that a maximum similarity and a transfer are at the same time part of the sampling practice. Döhl is convinced that the judgment is not allowing sampling overall because the named requests are too high.</p>
<p align="left">In the discussion this interesting question was raised: Who exactly is the music producer and who owns the ancillary rights? Is there a difference between the right to the master tapes and the one to the recordings? When it comes to parody Döhl said the German jurisdiction is accepting it via “Free Use” but free use is not limited to parody. He emphasized that mashup is not only about parody! As another point a listener was asking whether source code in copyright which is also mashed up frequently should be treated in the same way like music.</p>
<h3 align="left"><b>Bernd Justin Jütte: <em>The EU's trouble with Mashups</em></b></h3>
<p align="left">The following talk also dealt with mashups but Jütte widened the scope to the European level. Here is his abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“New tools for editing of digital images, music and films have opened up new possibilities to enable wider circles of society to engage in ’artistic’ activities of different qualities. User generated content (UGC), a term that already transmits a notion of amateur artists, has produced a plethora of new forms of artistic expression. One type of UGC are mashups, which are compositions that combine existing works (often) protected by copyright, and transform them into new original creations.<br />
The European legislative framework has not yet reacted to the copyright problems provoked by mashups. Whereas the flexible US fair use doctrine has ac-­‐ commodated mashups rather easily, the strict corset of limitations and exceptions in Art 5 (2)-­‐(3) of the InfoSoc Directive does not leave any, or only very little, room for this innovative and widely popular form of artistic expression for commercial or non-­commercial purposes. The paper analyzes the current European legal framework and identifies its insufficiencies with regard to enabling a legal mashup culture. By comparison with the US approach, an attempt is made to suggest solutions for the European legislator, based on the policy proposals of the EU Commission’s “Digital Agenda” and more recent policy documents (e.g. “On Content in the Digital Market”, “Licenses for Europe”). In this context a dis-­‐ tinction is made between non-­‐commercial mashup artists and the emerging commercial mashup scene.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Jütte showed mashup examples like <a href="http://www.chungkong.nl/star-warhols/" target="_blank">Star Warhols</a> and Munch v Batman that are taking inspiration from the original work while examples like <a href="http://www.artsology.com/mashup_1.php" target="_blank">Vermeer/Picass/Lichtenstein (Artsology)</a> show real cutting and mixing. He also showed one of the most famous mashups, the Pop Danthology 2012 by Daniel Kim:</p>

<p align="left">[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7j_E8VHUoQ?rel=0]</p>
<p align="left">Because of this diversity Jütte defined mashups by the following aspects: (1) exclusively existing material, (2) horizontal and vertical combination, (3) more than one song, (4) sources recognizable, (5) (popular songs). With regards to the law the following legal implications have to be mentioned: reproduction, making available, communication to public, musical composition and sound recording. In order to look at the European case Jütte started to analyse the relevant factors in the US. Mashups under US-copyright law can possibly be defended under fair use. The Fair Use doctrine is praised to be flexible although it allows transformative works only if several aspects are confirmed and especially the tranformativeness is high enough. The case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music,_Inc." target="_blank">Campbell v Acuff-Rose Music Inc. 1994</a> answered the question that mashups are transformative and can be protected via Fair Use even when money is earned.</p>
<p align="left">For the EU-perspective the Directive 2001/29/EU and, as a part of the digital agenda for Europe, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/docs/2011/audiovisual/green_paper_COM2011_427_en.pdf" target="_blank">Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works</a> in the EU (COM(2011) 427 final ??? [[LINK]]) (2011) are important. They state that mashups are regarded in the wider realm of user-generated content (UGC). Exceptions to copyright law are granted if criticism and review (problem: originality), caricature, parody or pastiche are found. The Deckman Case (C-429 ???) dealt with parody at EU-level. At the end of his presentation Jütte described his position regarding the normal case of the disabling of mashups: He would like to see mashups being enabled in non-commercial, in other words exceptions for obvious NC-purposes. He referred to Lawrence Lessig who once said that there should be exceptions for private persons and children in their bedroom [[[ ???quote Lessig]. But Jütte was also clear about the fact that the implementation of such an exception is very difficult. For commercial mashups we might see compulsory licensing or even a one-stop stop in the near future. Jütte concluded that the<b> </b>EU has less flexibility than the US and that the idea to implement "Licenses for Europe" failed until now. We keep on making bilateral agreements but legal uncertainty prevails.</p>
<p align="left">Again in the discussion several interesting topics have been raised. A really surprising question was:<b> </b>What are we doing with mashup-artists that don't see themselves as parody or criticism (i.e. "no copyright” or guerrilla activists). Another problem are the moral rights: What if the works are being fragmented against the wish of the author? So maybe the commercial side could be fixed in the future, but what about the moral rights? One participant of the conference added the US-legal case called Pretty woman in which ???]]]</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lionel Bently (University of Cambridge): De-naturalizing Musical Authorship</b></p>
<p align="left">Bently, one of the most prominent scholars in copyright and music issues, focused the authorship as a central element of copyright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Determinations of who counts as an ‘author’ of a musical work has a number of legal consequences.  Most obviously, it governs who count as the first owners of copyright, and thus who benefits from revenue streams associated with publishing/ recording (mechanicals) and performance (including broadcasting and streaming).  Secondly, it is relevant to the duration of copyright – the term of copyright in music and lyrics being calculated by reference (i.e. currently seventy years after) the death of the author (or in the case of co-authorship the last author to die). Third, being an author entitles a person to be named as such when a work is published or recordings are distributed: authors are granted what is known as the ‘moral right’ of attribution.<br />
Copyright law has tended to assume that the legal concept of authorship maps onto a natural, flesh-and-blood, human beings. It thus is typically taken for granted that identifying who is an author for one purpose (say, ownership) necessarily operates to identify the author for other purposes (term, attribution).  In so doing, the dominant arena for determining authorship concerns ownership. Here the rules have developed rather restrictively, so as to exclude from the category of authors a perhaps surprising range of contributions (as seen most clearly in the Spandau Ballet case, Hadley v Kemp). But the effect of such an approach is not just to exclude contributors from counting as owners, but also from being entitled to attribution.<br />
Certainly, one can see the logic in assuming that the word ‘author’ means the same thing in different parts of a statute, and indeed the convenience in so doing. However, if we consider the legal task of ascribing authorship as informed by matters of policy, the assumed unity or integrity of ‘authorship’ in copyright seems problematic.  The policy considerations that underpin restricting who counts as an author in the three domains – ownership, term and attribution – are very different. By exploring these policies in more detail, I want to suggest that copyright law could respond more flexibly to a diverse range of creative practices if it recognised that the legal concept of authorship is not ‘natural’. One consequence of so doing might at least to be to afford rights of attribution to a wider array of contributors than are currently accommodated by the moral right of attribution.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The importance of the authorship benefits the authors by granting economic and moral rights like attribution and integrity for the term “life plus 70 years”. Authorship is assumed to be unitary (LIT: Copinter???) and and 'natural' --&gt; QUOTE Copinter</p>
<p align="left">But the case law is primarily on economic rights. Based on that Bently took an intensive look at the <b>"</b>work of joint<b> </b>authorship". There is no distinction between different types of contributions possible. The UK-case Hadley v Kemp [1999] EMLR 589 ??? on the "Spandau ballet" dealt with a struggle between band members. Especially the saxophone solo and the question whether Gary Kemp is the sole composer? The court said: "The saxophone solo is just a standard fill." Overall Bentley explained that there are many ways of understanding Hadley v Kemp:</p>
<p align="left"><i>- </i>romantic authorship</p>
<p align="left">- composition vs. performance</p>
<p align="left">- peculiar facts</p>
<p align="left">- the influence of the musicologist</p>
<p align="left">But Bentley <em>argued that it would perhaps be more plausibly that Kemp has more rights and the others aren't co-authors when they contribute only a little bit. Viewing them as co-authors would give them the same rights like Kemp and that would not be fair. In the US you can find the same decision: </em>Childress v. Taylor (Judge Newman) ???</p>
<p align="left">Bentley is BEOBACHTEN sceptic about the following situation which the law is trying to exclude: An old-authors gets a young co-author and thereby is prolonging the term of the copyright. The famous example for this case is “O sole Mio” that showed how extremely difficult it is to rule on co-authorship. One major problem is that no one opposes those co-author-prolongations, because it is only in the interest of the public to shorten copyright-terms. Bentley also mentioned the case Sawkins v Hyperion [2005] EWCA Civ 565 ????</p>
<p align="left">As a conclusion Bentley highlighted the complexity of the three different types of author-related copyrights: (1) ownership and thereby revenue, (2) term of copyright ; authorship leads to presumptions, (3) ‘moral right’ of attribution. In the digital age musical production and contribution has changed and because of that Bentley thinks that we need to diverse the authorship idea.</p>
<p align="left">Bentley’s talk was ERGÄNZT by Ananay Aguilar’s talk “The Value of <i>performance</i> in law”. She argued that the distinction between authorship and performer is illusionary. Only the fixation in a score marks this difference. She was also wondering why there is no authorship of the arrangement by looking at the cases <a href="http://www.leeandthompson.com/2009/09/24/fisher-%E2%80%93v-brooker-others-2009-ukhl-41/">Fischer v Booker</a> ??? and Godfrey v Lees 1995</p>
<p align="left"> ???. Also important is <a href="http://www.simkins.com/news/heartbrockeninfringementolb29042013/">Henderson v AATW</a>. With regards to the performer's rights there is a lack of simplicity and performers are always second. Kretschmer ???LIT?? conducted a research on their contracts and how they are treated therein.
